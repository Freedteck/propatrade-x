## Real Use Case: Alice Buys a Home

Alice finds a property listed by Bob on PropaTradex. She deposits the purchase amount into escrow. Bob confirms he's ready to transfer the property. Alice inspects and confirms satisfaction. The smart contract automatically:

- Releases payment to Bob
- Transfers property ownership to Alice
- Mints receipt NFTs for both parties

All transparent, secure, and instant—no middlemen, no delays.

## How It Works

1. **Users register** with KYC details (auto-verified).
2. **Sellers list properties** with prices, images, videos, and documents.
3. **Buyers/renters deposit funds** into escrow smart contracts.
4. **Both parties confirm** when satisfied with the transaction.
5. **Smart contract executes**:
   - Releases funds to seller
   - Transfers ownership (for sales)
   - Tracks rental period (for rentals)
   - Mints receipt NFTs
6. **Disputes resolved** by platform admins if needed.
